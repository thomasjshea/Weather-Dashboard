# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application is a Weather Dashboard. The user will type in a city, or select from a list of previously searched cities. The application will then output the current conditions for that city along with a 5 day forecast. As someone who travels and enjoys participating in outdoor activities, it is important for me to know the weather forcast so I can plan ahead.
